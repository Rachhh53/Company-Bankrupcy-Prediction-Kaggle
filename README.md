## Management/Research Question
<br>
<strong>In layman’s terms, what is the management/research question of interest, and why would anyone care?  
Requirements</strong>
<br>
Split the training set into an 80% training and 20% validation set and conduct / improve upon previous EDA. Build at least three models: an SVM, a logistic regression model, a Naïve Bayes model. Evaluate each of the models’ assumptions. Conduct hyperparameter tuning for the SVM kernel. Evaluate goodness of fit metrics including TPR, FPR, precision, recall, and accuracy on the training and validation sets. Build ROC and Precision / Recall graphs. Evaluate your models' performance on the validation set using the F1-score.  Python scikit-learn should be your primary environment for conducting this research.

<h3>Management/Research Question</h3>
<br>
<strong>In layman’s terms, what is the management/research question of interest, and why would anyone care?</strong>
<br>
<br>
Requirements:
<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Split the training set into an 80% training and 20% validation set and conduct / improve upon previous EDA. </li>
<li>Build at least three models: an SVM, a logistic regression model, a Naïve Bayes model.</li>
<li>Evaluate each of the models’ assumptions. Conduct hyperparameter tuning for the SVM kernel.</li>
<li>Evaluate goodness of fit metrics including TPR, FPR, precision, recall, and accuracy on the training and validation sets.</li>
<li>Build ROC and Precision / Recall graphs. Evaluate your models' performance on the validation set using the F1-score.</li>
<li>Python scikit-learn should be your primary environment for conducting this research.</li>
</ul>
